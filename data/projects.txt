Bike Store Management System
• Architected a relational database system optimizing purchasing, user, and supply chain logistics through indexing, stored
procedures, and triggers, while designing RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on inventory and user data, enabling seamless
integration with OLAP for real-time data analysis and reporting.
EV Chatbot
• Utilized SQL and Python for data cleaning, transformation, and insight extraction, and engineered a Tableau dashboard to
visualize 10-year electric vehicle demand trends with optimized SQL-based data storage for in-depth market analysis.
• Developed an AI-powered application using LangChain, RAG, and fine-tuned models to provide rapid, data-driven answers to
business intelligence queries on EV trends.
H-Predict
• Applied data modeling and statistical analysis to predict healthcare costs (R²: 0.911) using regression and clustering
methods, and developed a Streamlit dashboard with Django visualizations for deeper cost insights, adjusted for inflation.
YELP Review Analysis
• Developed a Big Data ETL pipeline leveraging Hadoop, Hive, Kafka, PySpark, and MongoDB to analyze YELP reviews and
ratings, providing real-time sentiment insights using ML models.
• Utilized Spark Streaming to ingest real-time YELP review data from Kafka and employed Spark SQL with Hive for efficient
query execution, data aggregation, and optimized storage of structured review data.
Personality AI
• Developed and deployed an AI chatbot emulating Elon Musk’s persona using RAG,Vector Store (FAISS,Pinecone), NLP,
Lang Chain and fine-tuned LLM models with custom training data utilizing Google Cloud, BigQuery and Apache Airflow.
• Applied user stories and product project management to design scalable data pipelines, build a data warehouse for
conversation history, and integrate secure API key management for deployment.
Pothole Detection System
• Engineered an IoT-based pothole detection system utilizing multiple sensor arrays (accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS) to identify road surface anomalies in real-time, implementing data streaming protocols for continuous monitoring and geospatial mapping integration.
• Developed a scalable data pipeline using MQTT/Kafka for sensor data ingestion, applied signal processing algorithms and ML classification models (Random Forest, SVM) to achieve 92% pothole detection accuracy, and deployed RESTful APIs for real-time map visualization.
• Integrated sensor data with cloud infrastructure (AWS IoT Core/Google Cloud IoT) and implemented geospatial databases (PostGIS/MongoDB) to store pothole coordinates, severity metrics, and timestamps, enabling automated road maintenance prioritization dashboards.
• Designed an interactive web-based mapping interface using Leaflet.js/Google Maps API to visualize detected potholes with severity heat maps, historical trend analysis, and automated alert notifications to municipal authorities for proactive infrastructure management.
