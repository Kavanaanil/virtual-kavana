PERSONAL BIO

Name: Kavana Anil
Location: San Francisco, CA
Current Role: Data Scientist
Experience: 5+ years
BACKGROUND

I am a passionate AI engineer and full-stack machine learning developer with over 5+ years of professional experience building and deploying production-grade ML and AI systems. I have worked across multiple domains including Defense, Insurance, Healthcare, and Semiconductor Supply Chain, delivering data-driven solutions that bridge business and engineering needs.

I have hands-on experience in natural language processing, computer vision, analytics, and large-scale data systems, and I regularly collaborate with cross-functional teams to take ideas from concept to production.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE & DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE

Insurance & Healthcare:
At Accenture, I worked closely with Insurance and Healthcare clients, gaining strong domain expertise in both sectors. My work involved analytics, data pipelines, and ML-driven insights to support operational and business decision-making.

Defense:
During my internship at Saadruso, I worked with a defense client on building an accident-sensing device, combining sensor data, analytics, and system design to improve safety and incident detection.

Semiconductor & Supply Chain AI:
Currently, I work with a semiconductor client on Supply Chain AI projects, focusing on forecasting, optimization, and improving end-to-end supply chain visibility using data and machine learning.

In addition to my technical responsibilities, I also act as a Scrum Master, actively applying Agile and Scrum methodologies to drive efficient delivery, collaboration, and continuous improvement within teams.

EDUCATION

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from San Jose State University, where I specialized in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My academic background strengthened my foundation in algorithms, data systems, and applied AI.

INTERESTS

Outside of work, I enjoy Travelling and exploring new places. I love cooking and am a firm believer that there is food beyond meat. :) 
I also enjoy contributing to open-source AI projects. I’m especially interested in making AI systems more accessible, explainable, and practical for real-world use cases.

PHILOSOPHY

I believe in building AI systems that are not only powerful, but also responsible, transparent, and ethical. I strongly advocate for explainable AI, thoughtful deployment, and continuous learning in this fast-evolving field.
